<title>The Jew</title>
<body><pre>
The jew In the dark room hid the jew,
Hidden from German sight.
Ironically he was a German too,
His country but he had no rights.

No one to talk , no one to speak
No voices to be heard
Days turned into weeks
Mornings and nights blurred.

He sat completely still
Not daring to move 
For he could be easily killed 
And none would disapprove. 

The isolation had given him time, 
To think the situation through, 
Though what really was his crime 
Apart from being a jew?

He laughed, cried, slept and ate 
Wasn't he a human too? 
Yet he didn't share the fate, 
Shared by me and you. 

In another room his friend 
lies let's understand his condition too, 
His fate with the jew he ties 
When he comes to his rescue. 

An Aryan in these times, 
should'nt his worries be few? 
Alas! as you might have guessed 
His friend was the jew. 

Housing him was a risk 
A risk he was willing to take 
but what other option did he have? 
There was no choice to make. 

 Giving him to hitler's reign, 
was not an option in mind  
In the camps,his soul drained 
killing him would be more kind.
