<h1>parents</h1><pre>
 Down in the streets below,
 a few children played
 Now they,ve gone abroad you know
 settled in some trade. 
 
 How funny is time though
 How fast does it fly
 With time ,the children grow 
 Then they bid goodbye. 
 
 In their careers I hope they glow,
 But i have a caveat in mind 
 Sometimes you should take it slow
 Don't leave your parents behind.
 
 Reasons I'll tell you so,
 Don't take my word for this 
 Next time you're in town go 
 Meet and find what you've missed. 
 
You'll find they,ve aged a bit.
The troubles they have borne, 
However if you ask it,
these things they won't let on. 

 You are right now in your prime
 Your life is going to be vast
 THEY are here for a fleeting time
 Enjoy it while it lasts.
