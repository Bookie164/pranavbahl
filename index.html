<h1> parents </h1>

 <pre>Down in the streets below, a few children played Now they,ve gone abroad you know settled in some trade. 
 How funny is time though How fast does it fly With time ,the children grow Then they bid goodbye. 
 In their careers I hope they glow, But i have a caveat in mind Sometimes you should take it slow Don't leave your parents behind. 
 Reasons I'll tell you so, Don't take my word for this Next time you're in town go Meet and find what you've missed.</pre>
