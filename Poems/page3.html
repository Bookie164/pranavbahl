  <h2><pre>
 "I am a bystander in this night,
  What I see is what I write,
  The child was in a sorry plight.
  Not helping him, I regret quite" 
</pre></h2>
 <pre>
 The moon shone strong and bright 
 Through the stormy clouds, cut the light. 
 A child sits by the roadside 
 Torn clothes, his face white. 
 
 No one to groom, no one to care 
 As was evident in his messy hair 
 His eyes though, a steady stare 
 A gazing look, lied the moon where 
 
 A sorrow here, in his eyes 
 As he watches the moon in the skies 
 To stop the tears, he really tries 
 But in the end, the child cries. 
 
 The poor boy, hysterical and mad 
 You just know that he's had it bad 
 As he screams, sounds his voice sad 
 Calling out to his mum and dad 
 
 This night though, was something new
 A shadow in the dark, I was there too 
 If only had I offered help, given a cue 
 The child here, could have been like you.
