  Now I'll tell you about me 
  As we head towards the end 
  All this that you see 
  All the poems penned. 
  
  I don't really prepare for it,
  No rough lines of rhyme 
  Although I do admit 
  It does take some time. 
  
  I just look around a bit 
  For a message I can spell 
  Maybe adding some humor and wit 
  As probably you can tell. 
  
  On a serious note though 
  There is so much looking around 
  Everything's a poem you know 
  Just listen for it's sound.
