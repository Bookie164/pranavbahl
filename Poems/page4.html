 <h1>Wasted</h1><br><hr><br><br>
  <pre>
The man sits on the broken chair 
Holding his bottle of rum, 
The air of indifference this man wears 
His worries are none. 

 No care or thoughts cross his mind 
 As he watches the tv screen 
 To the content however he is blind 
 As his awareness begins to wean. 
 
 Drunk he slides down in the chair 
 Sleep is this it seems 
 This man too once had flair 
 But it's now all now a dream.
 
 This was not what he wanted to be  
 With this I'm sure you agree, 
 he door was there waiting for him 
 Only midway he lost the key.
