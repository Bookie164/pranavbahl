 <h1>The Boy</h1><br><hr><br><br>
  <pre>
 What do you want to be? 
 The small child is asked, 
 I'll be a sailor in the sea! 
 A captain in the oceans vast. 
 
 Angry, they look on as he 
 Explains his dreams unasked, 
 Waiting just to disagree, 
 As he finishes his story at last. 
 
 Now wait boy, listen to me 
 That's not what I asked, 
 You are now little older, 
 you see These ideas please don't cast 
 
 So the child really never is free 
 His future is already marked 
 He will, forever hold this plea 
 Always regretting the past. 
 
 Your child will grow up you see 
 He will grow up fast
 What do you want to be? 
 He too one day will ask 
 
 What then would you expect of him? 
 I'll warn you,don't be aghast, 
 He'll do the same thing 
 his parents did in the past.
