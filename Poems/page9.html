  <pre>
  The path into two it breaks, 
  The point where you stand, 
  The choice everyone makes 
  Is the one you too can. 
  
  You could do the same thing 
  As others did in your state, 
  Your dreams you could cling 
  While you do what you hate. 
  
  Going to work for a pay 
  Doing what is "right" 
  Working throughout the day 
  Coming home at night. 
  
  Tired of doing what you do 
  Yet you just can't quit 
  "I'll just see this year through" 
  To your job, but you stick 
  
  Let's see the alternative now
  For I've shown one side to you 
  The other side plays out how 
  Consider this point of view: 
  
  A man goes from his place 
  To his work in a small car 
  "Oh I'm tired" or so he says 
  But the truth could'nt be more far.
  
  He may not earn as much as you 
  Nor have the luxuries you may 
  But you realize human needs are few 
  Happiness is one I say. 
  
  Don't get me wrong, please 
  If I may request, 
  It's personal I know, 
  things like these 
  You know yourself the best 
  
  A question you may ask though 
  Is all this relevant to you? 
  This one maybe you should know 
  In your heart, you know what's true.
