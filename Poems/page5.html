  <pre>
  15 rockets reached the moon 
  Each one from it's own place, 
  The satellites, everywhere they're strewn 
  Just thrown in outer space. 
  
  Research is done by everyone 
  Creations, inventions by all 
  Same things are again tested and done 
  By countries, big or small 
  
  Every country wants it good 
  Good for itself that is, 
  Keeping things under the hood, 
  Saying it's hers or his. 
  
  Each flag takes a different way 
  Nothing to join us all, 
  Repetition comes into play, 
  Bringing innovation to a crawl. 
  
  If only we could mature a bit 
  Free the chains of race 
  If work and data could be split 
  The world would be a better place.
