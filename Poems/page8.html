  The poem exists, So the message can'ʼ

  I'll tell you then what "The Poem" is: — 
  (Will try to keep it small, but no promises) 
  
  It is a take on the many traits, 
  Of our systems very sorry state 
  
  "Oh you are wrong, Oh you are late" 
  The poor are just made to wait 
  
  Then enters from the college's stand, 
  Face held high, money in hand 
  
  He walks slow, no show of guilt 
  As he hands what his dad has built 
  
  The poor meanwhile, just shakes his head 
  "Education's for all" was all he said 
  
  After all the trouble, all that time 
  All the dreams where he was to shine? 
  
  (And now, I end, the couplets rhyme
  For I wish to express the message of mine) 
  
  The will was there, 
  the intent too, 
  This "money for admission" 
  this was new. 
  
  With a heavy heart 
  his documents he threw 
  On the dusty road 
  everywhere they flew. 
  
  Witnesses you say? 
  That's me and you 
  Add if I may, 
  How could this be true? 
  
  Of course you know! 
  You see it all day 
  The seed you sow 
  When you choose to pay 
  
  But when it's time 
  When you are swayed 
  Please remember this rhyme 
  Do not let it fade.
