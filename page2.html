<title>Bullying</title>

  <pre>
It's easy to criticize, 
laugh and burn 
When all he tries 
Is to share and learn 
It's easy to mock 
Everything he's done 
His projects, his talks 
His every turn 
His every move, 
His way of fun 
A poem written 
A story spun 

No harm you say? 
No evil done? 
Children they play 
Worries are none? 

Well here is the wrong
You understand, I pray 
When it's gone too long 
It's no long a play 

No matter how strong 
How tough the display 
The child he'sÂ  gone, 
He's gone astray.
